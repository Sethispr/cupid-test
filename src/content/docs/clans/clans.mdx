## Clan Tokens

Clan tokens are used for upgrading a clan's level. 

Upgrading a clan level will give a +1% stat bonus to **all stats** (HP, ATK, DEF, SPD), unlike other bots that boost only one stat. 

To earn tokens, use `=bt all` or the alias `=bt max` in a **defeated floor**.

## Viewing Clan Info

- Type `=cl` to see basic clan details.
- Type `=cl view` to check the amount of clan tokens needed for stat upgrades and basic clan details.
- Type `=cl member` to view clan members and their clan token contributions.

### Examples

**Do**:
- `=cl create` (as **Server Owner**)
- `=bt max` (battle all in a **defeated floor** to get **clan tokens**)

**Don't**:
- Attempt `=cl create` as an Administrator. (only **Server Owner** can create a clan)
