The current Event Raid series is **Honkai: Star Rail**.

To view the cards from the event, type `=cdex -s Star Rail`.

- Each **event raid win** grants x1 **Oneiric Shard**.
- Collect **6 event shards** to redeem a card from the series using `=redeem` or the alias `=rdm`.
- Check your shard count with `=orbs` or the alias `=items`.

Redeem chances: here

To spawn an event raid, type `=rd espawn [difficulty e.g. e, etc]` Event raids will spawn more frequently than other series.

:::note[Event Tip]  

Join and spawn (`=rd espawn e)` **Easy Difficulty** raids, it will be faster to finish a raid with other people too.

:::

## Examples

Do:
- `=cdex -s Star Rail` (shows the event series card list)
- `=rd espawn e` (spawns an easy difficulty event raid)
- `=rdm` (redeems a random event card, do after collecting 6 shards)

**Don't**:
- Redeem with less than 6 shards.
