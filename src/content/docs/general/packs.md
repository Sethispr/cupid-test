Packs are obtained through the shop `=pshop`, `=dpshop` and `=emberpack`

:::note

Ember packs are not in the pack shop, they are a separate pack. There are 2 pack shops, the regular `=pshop` and the daily `=dpshop` (costs more than regular packs) which has fixed series and rotates every day 

:::

There are 8 types of packs: `Rusty Relics Pack`, `Standard Deck Pack`, `Gold Back Pack`, `Secret Glow Pack`, `Mythic Chronicles Pack`, `Cosmic Odyssey Pack`, `Lost Treasures Pack` and `Ember Pack` (**not** in `=pshop`)

To buy a pack, type `=pbuy [pack name/number]`. Each pack you buy will give you 6 random cards.
