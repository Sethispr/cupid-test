## Rarity Details

- Rarities are fixed and **not upgradeable**.
- Focus building `Mythic` cards early for stronger teams. Starlight Rare cards are primarily obtained from packs, especially `=emberpack`.
- Each rarity has a specific level cap:

| Rarity           | Level Cap |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| `Basic`          | 20        |
| `Rare`           | 30        |
| `Super Rare`     | 50        |
| `Secret Rare`    | 60        |
| `Mythic`         | 70        |
| `Starlight Rare` | 80        |
