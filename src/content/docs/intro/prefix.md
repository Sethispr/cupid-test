title: Prefix
description: Page explaining how to use commands with the bot's prefix.
---

The default prefix for Cupid Bot is `=`. You can also use the bot by **mentioning** it (e.g. `@Cupid`) or using **Discord slash commands** (e.g. `/`). Currently, the prefix cannot be changed.

- **Default Prefix**: You can only use the prefix `=` in the **bot's DM**.
- **Mention Method**: Mention `@Cupid` to use commands (e.g. `@Cupid id`)
- **Slash Commands**: Use `/` for specific actions (e.g. `/identity`)

:::note

The `=` prefix is now deprecated. Only `@Cupid` mentions and `/` slash commands will be supported until Discord allows message intents.

### Examples

**Do**:

- `=nick shiro` (only works in DM's)
- `@Cupid id`
- `/clan`

**Don't**:

- Try to change the prefix (not supported)
- Use `=` commands in a channel/server (use `@Cupid` or `/` instead)
