Use the `=setspawn` command to set a specific channel for card drops.

:::note

Only the Server Owner can set the spawn channel.

<TabItem label="Examples">

**Do:**  
- Go to the channel you want for card drop spawns and type `=setspawn`. You will then see a message from the bot saying "Spawns Redirected to here." if successful.  
- `=setspawn` in your card drops channel  

**Don't:**  
- `=setspawn [#channel-name]` (it won't work and will only set the spawns to the channel where you typed it).
