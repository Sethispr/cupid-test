import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Use the `=setspawn` command at the channel you want the bot to drop cards, it will set that channel for card drops.

:::note[Permissions]

Only the Server Owner can set the spawn channel.

### Examples

**Do**:

<Steps>

1. Go to the channel you want for card drop spawns and type `=setspawn`. You will then see a message from the bot saying "Spawns Redirected to here." if successful.

2. `=setspawn` in your card drops channel (sets the card drops to the channel you used the command in)

</Steps>

**Don't**:

- `=setspawn [#channel-name]` (it will work but will only set the spawns to the channel where you typed it, not the one you wanted)
